## Smart Car Parking System

In malls and offices, there are huge parking lots having a large number of parking spots for vehicles. Often it happens that a driver has to search for a long time to find a single parking spot.

Considering this niche problem, we planned to build a smart car parking system that can help the drivers find a perfect car parking spot when they enter the parking arena.

In this project, we will build a mobile application that can help the driver spot an empty space to park the car. This repo consits of the Frontend React-Native Application required for the mobile.
